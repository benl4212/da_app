## Details - this project was started July, 2025 and hopes to find a general solution to analyzing power grid data, by allowing customized features to be extracted from the data.

	    Currently supported: POWER DATA SCHEMAS

        * Rolling Window FFT
        * Lomb-Scargle Periodgram (GPU accelerated) w/ power spectral density
        
    - Advanced Analysis
        * Continous Wavelet Transform
        * Lyapunov Exponents & Fractal Dimension
        * Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) w/ determinism and laminarity


# Usage
You can run this app in a docker container by downloading docker desktop for your device: 
https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/

then open a terminal and use 
```bash
docker run -d -p 8501:8501 benl4212/grid-data-app:latest
```
# Future plans
* Trying to figure out gpu acceleration on a raspberry pi 5 to allow remote inference
* More genres than just power grid data e.g. network traffic (tcp/ip packet headers), instrumentation/sensor data, modbus
